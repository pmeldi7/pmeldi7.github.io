    <br/>
    <p>Use an extra pillow to support your. Why you can’t exercise after tooth extraction ‘once you’ve had a tooth removed, there’s a clot that needs to form in the hole created within the first 24 hours. For this reason, people usually have their teeth removed to prevent chewing problems and pain the moment these teeth erupt</p>
        <h3>It Is Important This Clot Remains In The Socket, Acting As A Plug.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>5 days after wisdom teeth removal and still in pain. Depending on the procedure, you can eat solid food after one or two weeks of wisdom tooth removal. If you only had your upper wisdom teeth removed, you can return to exercise sooner than those who had lower wisdom teeth removed, since this is a less traumatic procedure.</p>

    <br/>
    <p>You can do light activities such as walking, cycling, and other similar activities that do not pressure the surgery site. Wait at least 72 hours. Strenuous exercises and works should be avoided, such as stretching, bending over, or heavy lifting;</p>
        <h3>Pain After Wisdom Tooth Extraction Usually Lasts From 3 Days To One Week, Unless You Experience An Infection Or Dry Socket, Which Happens When The Blood Clot Gets Dislodged From The Extraction Site.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>After the wisdom teeth removal, you will likely be told to rest and recover for a few days. But it’s important to listen to your body and take things slowly. Limit exercise after wisdom teeth extract for the next 4 days.</p>
        <h3>You Should Also Avoid Anything That Could Get Stuck In The Extraction Site And Dislodge The Blood Clot.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Avoid strenuous activity and exercise for a few days; After wisdom teeth removal, you can also expect some bleeding for the first few hours. When can you eat solid food after wisdom teeth removal?</p>
